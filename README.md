# Overview:
This project was developed as part of the CSE-108 course in Level-2, Term-1 at BUET. It focuses on creating a networked application using Java, demonstrating practical applications of Java networking concepts, client-server architecture, and object-oriented programming.

# Project Details:
Development Time: 4 weeks
Collaboration: Individual project
Language Used: Java

# Key Features:
Client-Server Architecture: Implements a robust client-server model for network communication.
Multithreading: Supports concurrent client connections using Java multithreading.
Information Sharing: Facilitates information transfer between clients and the server.
Real-Time Update: Updates information in real-time across clients without requiring page refresh.
Hashing Method: Connects individual clients to the server using hashing, enabling easy identification of message sources.
Modular Design: Organized into packages for common classes, client-side functions, and server-side functions.
